    </header>
    <p>
      My name is Talvin, a dedicated student currently taking programming
      lessons with a budding interest in the world of development. I love
      exploring the basics of coding and am excited about the potential to
      create innovative projects in the future. When I'm not studying, you'll
      find me watching movies, playing tennis with the boys, taking refreshing
      naps, or capturing moments in black and white photography. My goal is to
      become a skilled developer and contribute to exciting tech projects that
      make a difference.
